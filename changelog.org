All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

* [0.0.2] - 2025-01-20

** Added
- Major mode ~slack-search-mode~ derived from ~org-mode~ with custom keymap and hook support
- File attachments display with clickable links, human-readable sizes, and file types
- Support for shared messages from other channels with proper metadata display
- Shared messages show as subheadings with italicized metadata line including author, channel, and timestamp links

** Fixed
- Race condition that caused empty results on first search attempt
- Pagination logic to prevent auto-loading next page on initial search
- Buffer switching timing to ensure content is fully rendered before display
- Proper indentation using ~indent-region~ for all org-mode content

** Changed
- Buffer formatting now uses proper org-mode structure with consistent spacing
- Shared message display uses subheadings (~**~) instead of quote blocks
- Error handling improved for HTTP response parsing with better user feedback
