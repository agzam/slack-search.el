** Changed
- Renamed project from ~slack-search~ to ~slacko~ (a.k.a. "El Slacko")
- All symbol prefixes updated: ~slack-search-~ -> ~slacko-~, ~slack-mrkdwn-~ -> ~slacko-mrkdwn-~, ~slack-creds-~ -> ~slacko-creds-~, ~slack-thread-~ -> ~slacko-thread-~
- Main entry point is now ~slacko-search~ (was ~slack-search~)

** Added
- Inline image display in thread buffers - images are downloaded and rendered directly
- ~slacko-thread-inline-images~ and ~slacko-thread-image-max-width~ customization options
- Channel mention resolution: ~<#CHANNEL_ID|>~ now displays as clickable ~#channel-name~ links
- Strikethrough conversion: Slack's ~~text~~ now renders as org's ~+text+~
- Blockquote conversion: ~&gt; text~ renders with ~│~ prefix and custom faces
- ~slacko-mrkdwn-blockquote-face~ and ~slacko-mrkdwn-blockquote-bar-face~ for quote styling

** Fixed
